Shokuho for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord is a large-scale total conversion mod inspired by Japan’s Sengoku period. It replaces Calradia with a Japanese-themed world featuring historical clans, unique units, armor, weapons, banners, settlements, and immersive gameplay systems designed around feudal warfare and clan politics.
